It offers two modes, the first will attempt to analyze the current function while the other will attempt to find all functions that are merely obfuscated strings and rename them. If the function name cannot be cleanly replaced, a comment will be added at all call locations with the detailed deobfuscated string in addition to the truncated rename.\n\n![](https://github.com/jamie-34254/binja_degobfuscate/blob/master/img/DeGObfuscate.gif?raw=true)", "license": {"name": "MIT", "text": "Copyright 2020 Kryptos Logic\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
